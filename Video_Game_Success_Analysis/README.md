Video Game Success Analysis
Project Type: Data Analysis | Business Analytics

Project Overview
This project analyzes historical video game sales data to identify patterns that contribute to a game's commercial success. Using sales figures, user and critic reviews, platform trends, and regional preferences, we uncover key insights to help businesses make data-driven marketing and strategy decisions.

Dataset
The dataset includes information on:
🔹 Game sales across different platforms and regions
🔹 User and critic review scores
🔹 ESRB ratings and genre classifications
🔹 Release year and platform trends
Dataset File:
video_game_sales.csv – The dataset used for analysis

Goals & Objectives
🔹 Analyze platform trends to identify which consoles drive the most sales.
🔹 Examine review scores to determine their impact on sales.
🔹 Identify the most profitable genres based on total and average sales.
🔹 Explore regional gaming preferences in North America, Europe, and Japan.
🔹 Test hypotheses about user ratings across platforms and genres.

Technologies Used
🔹 Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy)
🔹 Statistical Analysis: Hypothesis Testing (T-tests)
🔹 Data Processing: Handling missing values, feature engineering
🔹 Visualization: Sales trends, platform evolution, genre performance

Key Findings
Platform & Sales Trends
🔹 The number of games released peaked in 2008, with a steady decline afterward.
🔹 PS2, X360, and PS3 were the highest-selling platforms, reflecting their industry dominance during their lifespans.
🔹 Platforms follow a lifecycle—new ones emerge, peak, and eventually fade out.

Impact of Reviews on Sales
🔹 Critic scores have a moderate correlation with total sales, particularly on X360.
🔹 User scores show a weak correlation with sales, meaning critic reviews are often a stronger indicator of success.

Genre & Regional Analysis
🔹 Action, Shooter, and Sports games generate the highest total sales.
🔹 Shooter games consistently perform well, even when considering average sales per game.
🔹 Regional preferences vary—NA & EU favor M-rated games, while JP sales are driven by different platform trends.

Hypothesis Testing
✅ Xbox One vs. PC user ratings – There is a significant difference in average user ratings.
✅ Action vs. Sports genre user ratings – There is a significant difference in average user ratings.
